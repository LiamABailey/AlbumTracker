# AlbumTracker - WORK IN PROGRESS
#### Simple Web Interface for tracking Albums
#### Forked from LiamABailey/LearnDocker

I listen to a variety of albums on a lot of different platforms (Spotify, YouTube, Bandcamp, Soundcloud, and physical media), and often struggle to keep track of what I've listened to, especially when I can remember *aspects* of a song or album, but not the title. Consequently, I'm building a last.fm-inspired music (album) tracker, leveraging a manual web interface to input information, and presenting the data in a query-able manner for later search on a separate web interface.

I'm starting with the underlying API, which will then be rigged up to a JavaScript-based web app to receive and display data.
